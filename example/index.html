    <h1><b>ReScatter:</b> Reactive Scatter plots library examples</h1>
    <h2>Version 0.1</h2>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p1>The purpose of the ReScatter library is the quick production of sites containing very large (10^5 point)
    scatter plots which permit plot linking and selection brushing and the display of density maps. Selections can be exported for further analysis.
    The WebGL based plots and the ReScatter technology were first demonstrated on the
     <a href="brainscope.nl/brainscope">Brainscope</a> website</p1>.
    <h2>History and usage</h2>
    <h3>Brainscope framework refactored to ReScatter</h3>
    <p>On the original <a ref="brainscope.nl/brainscope">Brainscope</a> site the framework code was not minified or uglified in any way.
    As such anyone using the site could potentially reuse the code as supplied. However the framework, while divided into a number of
        classes, lacked a clear structure. In order to facilitate open source reuse the framework has been refactored and renamed ReScatter.</p>
    <h3>Usage and limitations</h3>
    <p>In its current form the library is still quite restricted in its applicability but if your need plots like those in the Brainscope
    site that much is possible. The first release has deliberately been given a low version number (0.1) to indicate that much more refactoring is needed
        to permit the easy reuse of key individual components such as the ReScatter.view.PointGroupView that forms the core of the WebGL based plots.</p>

            In theory this could be replaced by an alternative widget library.
            For Brainscope webix was a natural choice as the ontology tree and data selection sections could be easily created using the available controls. </p></td></tr>

    <h4>Note on tSNE dual view</h4>
    <p> A tSNE dual-view is a technique of creating a tSNE embedding on high dimensionality data over both the sample and data dimensions.
        The result is samples grouped according to the data dimensions and the data groups according to the samples.
        By linking the plots the user can discover which data points make the greatest contribution to the sample clusters</p>
