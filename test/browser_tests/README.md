This directory contains tests for GUI components of ReScatter.

Some of these tests are full end-to-end tests and require the 
compute backend to be running. The components are instantiated
on a number of dummy pages in the html subdirectory. Each of the 
test pages has a page object wrapping in the .pages directory to separate
the details of page layout from the actual tests.
