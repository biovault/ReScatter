## ReScatter

ReScatter is a library for building web-sites
containing very large reactive scatter plots. Features include:

 *  Interactive selections (based on nearest neighbour or area brushing)
 *  Selections relayed to linked plots or thematic maps.
 *  Loading predefined selections.
 *  High speed response using WebGL based toolkits (PixiJS).
 *  Option to display a density overlay on a plot.
 *  Site configurable selection colouring based on mouse interaction and plot meta data.
 *  Parallel display of one or thematic maps (based on SVG templates)
 *  Support for tree ontology base selection
 *  Ability to export selections or pass to site specific analysis plugins (can be an external website)
 
 The original use case that prompted the development of ReScatter was the need to display
 highly interactive, coupled tSNE embeddings on the [BrainScope](http://brainscope.nl) website.
